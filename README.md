# online-shopping application


This project is about designing and developing online shopping application, which provides only software and hardware products. Each product has its own specifications and is demonstrated in the product table. Products will be defined by the app admin and each customer, after being authenticated in login page, could order products. 

In this application, we have implemented MVC pattern. The JDBC used for this project is MySQL and has been set up in Apache server. We also used DAO layer as it maps OO Java model to MySQL Model and vice versa. Furthermore, based on the entities and its functionality, we have defined its CRUD operations.
For arranging view section of this application, I have used java FXML for keeping my GUI simple and clean. Also, CSS styling has been applied in the application interface. 
All the detailed info can be found in README file attached below.
